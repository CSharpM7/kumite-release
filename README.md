# Edgeguard Training

Replaces 100-man / Century Smash with an Edgeguard Training Tool. Fight off randomly spawning enemies, one at a time. You'll earn a point (represented by the inactive first CPU's precent) if you can knock them off the stage, but if they get onto the stage, you won't gain a point!
There's currently a 6 frame leniancy for when the CPU is considered "on stage" (via climbing from a ledge, landing, or etc), so use those frames to your advantage.

## Required Plugins
Arcropolis (you probably already have this)
Skyline (you probably already have this if you have the TMP)
[Smashline 2](https://github.com/HDR-Development/smashline/releases/latest)
[NRO Hook](https://github.com/ultimate-research/nro-hook-plugin/releases/latest)

## Installation 

place this in your mods folder like a skin mod or a stage mod. You should have a path "ultimate/mods/KumiteTraining/plugin.nro" or something similar 

## Wifi Safety Notice

While this mode should only run code during Century Smash (not even during Allstar/Cruel), I recommend not booting up quickplay with this mod active JUST in case.
I also have no idea how GSP will factor in to this, but you won't be able to defeat all 100 enemies to get a clear time, and this mode should be a lot slower than normal Century Smash is...
